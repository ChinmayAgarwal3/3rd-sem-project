  I wanted to use various APIs from different social media platforms and combine
  them into 1 platform which gives me only the content I want to see based on my
  interests.

## Overview

About the project and my motivation behind the idea:

> The Project is a simulation of creating a web app using Flask to see if I can use Reddit API to get content from specific subreddits and lately even use my reccommendation engine on top of it to get the best quality posts from Reddit.
>
>
>
> I use praw to get the data from the API and flask to generate it on a very basic HTML template for me.
>
> The test was a success and the project displays reddit posts in beautiful HTML cards with an infinite scroll.
>
> I will look forward to integrating more APIs and RSS to create my all in one platform.&#x20;
>
> I also wish to use social media data to fuel better reccomendations for myself.&#x20;
